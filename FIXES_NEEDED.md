# FIXES IN PROGRESS

## Issue 1: Contact & Search Pages Not Loading
**Problem:** Missing main header (Richmond CC logo + mega menu navigation)
**Solution:** Need to add header component between demo nav and main content

## Issue 2: Clean URLs
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
- All /index.html refs changed to / or /pages/section/
- Examples: / (home), /pages/contact/ (contact), /pages/search/ (search)

## Issue 3: Dropdown Nesting
**Status:** Checking for duplicate archived pages sections

## Files That Need Header Added:
- /pages/contact/index.html 
- /pages/search/index.html

The fastest solution is to rebuild these 2 pages using the structure from a working template (like academics/index.html) but keeping their specific content.
